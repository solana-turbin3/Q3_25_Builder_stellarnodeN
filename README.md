<h1> Q3 2025 Builders Cohort Repositories from stellarnodeN.</h1>

<h3> Q3 Builders Prerequisite </h3>

[*Q3_2025_Builders_Qualifier *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_2025_Builders_Qualifier)  : A comprehensive Turbin3 Q3-2025 qualification project showcasing core Solana development skills in both TypeScript and Rust. This toolkit covers essential blockchain interactions including wallet generation, base58 key conversions, devnet SOL airdrops, partial and full SOL transfers, and program enrollment. Great starting point for developers diving into Solana blockchain programming.

<h3> Q3 Solana Programs </h3>

[*Q3_2025_solana-starter *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_solana-starter)  :  A complete TypeScript starter kit for building and managing Solana SPL tokens and NFTs. Covers the full lifecycle from token creation to NFT minting, with integrated support for decentralized storage solutions (Irys, IPFS, Pinata) and Metaplex metadata standards. Perfect for developers looking to create digital assets on Solana with proper metadata handling.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_Vault *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_Anchor_Vault)  :  A secure personal vault system built with Anchor framework that gives users complete control over their SOL funds. Features include vault creation, deposits, withdrawals, and closure - all managed through Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for maximum security. Think of it as a self-custodial digital safe on the blockchain.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_Escrow *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_Anchor_Escrow)  :  A trustless token exchange system that enables peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries. Users can deposit tokens into secure escrow vaults, specify their desired exchange terms, and either complete trades automatically or cancel for full refunds. Eliminates counterparty risk through smart contract automation.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_AMM *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_Anchor_AMM)  :  An automated market maker implementing the constant product formula (x Ã— y = k) for decentralized token trading. Provides instant liquidity and fair pricing without traditional order books - users can swap tokens immediately at algorithmically determined rates. Built for permissionless trading with minimal slippage.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_NFT-Staking *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_NFT_Staking)  :  A sophisticated NFT staking platform that turns digital collectibles into yield-generating assets. Features collection verification, customizable reward mechanisms, configurable staking periods, and automated token distribution. NFT holders can lock their assets to accumulate points based on time and rarity, then claim fungible rewards while maintaining full custody through PDAs.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_NFT-Marketplace *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_NFT_Marketplace)  :  A decentralized NFT trading platform with secure escrow mechanics and automated fee distribution. Supports standard marketplace operations - listing NFTs in protected vaults, delisting for retrieval, and completing purchases with instant settlement. Features configurable treasury fees and eliminates platform custody risks through smart contract automation.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_Dice *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_Dice)  :  A provably fair dice betting game built on Solana using the Anchor framework. Players can place bets predicting dice roll outcomes (2-96 range) with payouts calculated using a constant house edge system. Features Ed25519 signature-based randomness generation for cryptographically verifiable fairness, secure vault management through PDAs, support for multiple concurrent bets per player, and automatic refund mechanisms for unresolved bets after timeout periods. The game implements transparent odds calculation where higher predictions yield better win chances but lower payout multipliers.

<h2> Q3 2025 Capstone - RecruSearch </h2>

[*Q3_2025_Capstone *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Capstone)  : RecruSearch is a decentralized research recruitment and data collection platform built on Solana using Anchor.It enables researchers to create, manage, and execute research studies while providing participants with transparent enrollment processes, on-chain consent management, and automated reward distribution. The core architecture features NFT-gated participation where participants receive Consent NFTs upon enrollment and Completion NFTs upon successful study completion. The system implements configurable eligibility criteria including age, gender, and location requirements with on-chain validation. Research data is securely stored on IPFS with cryptographic hashing, ensuring data integrity and privacy while maintaining decentralization.
