<h1> Q3 2025 Builders Cohort Repositories from stellarnodeN.</h1>

<h3> Q3 Builders Prerequisite </h3>

[*Q3_2025_Builders_Qualifier *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_2025_Builders_Qualifier)  : Turbin3 Q3-2025 Typescript and Rust qualifier programs. The project demonstrates how to interact with the Solana blockchain and includes functions like wallet generation, base58 key conversion, devnet SOL airdrop request, partial and full SOL transfers to turbin3 wallet, and program enrollment.

<h3> Q3 Solana Programs </h3>

[*Q3_2025_solana-starter *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_solana-starter)  : This is a TypeScript-based starter project for creating, minting, and transfering Solana SPL tokens and NFTs. The project demonstrates how to mint and transfer SPL tokens, upload NFT images and metadata to decentralized storage (Irys/IPFS/Pinata), and work with Metaplex metadata on Solana.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_Vault *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_Anchor_Vault)  :  A Solana smart contract built with the Anchor framework that implements a secure personal vault system. The program allows users to create, deposit, withdraw and close their own SOL vaults with full control over their funds.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_Escrow *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_Anchor_Escrow)  :  A decentralized escrow system built on Solana that enables trustless token exchanges between users without requiring a trusted third party. The program allows users to create escrow agreements by depositing tokens into a secure vault, specify what they want in return, and either complete the exchange or cancel and refund it.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_AMM *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_Anchor_AMM)  :  A decentralized exchange built on Solana that allows users to trade tokens automatically using smart contracts. This AMM implements the constant product formula (`x Ã— y = k`) to provide automated liquidity and enable permissionless token trading without traditional order books.

[*Q3_2025_Anchor_NFT-Staking *](https://github.com/stellarnodeN/Q3_25_NFT_Staking)  :  A NFT staking program built with the Anchor framework that enables NFT holders to lock their digital assets in smart contracts and earn token rewards over time. The program implements sophisticated reward mechanisms where users stake verified NFTs from specific collections to accumulate points based on configurable parameters, which can later be claimed as fungible reward tokens. Key features include collection verification for authenticity, customizable staking limits and freeze periods to prevent gaming, automated reward distribution, and full custody security through Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).
